to create a application like codeshare what do i need okay so one person will come and create a room and only he will be able to put something on the board and once he click on share button he will see a link and whoever joins on that link will be able to see the thing pasted there easy simple do-able okay then ek room ka model banega and  actually abhi ke liye toh ek hi modal banega room karke and it will not which will have a code and using that code anyone can join the room or maybe this can or lets see, i really like this project first lets write the backend for this then lets finish it off with the frontend part of it
  so the first thing i need to do is to create an room with a particular name no authentication is needed 
the first prototype of the backend of code Share platform is done for now , now all i need to do is to make the frontend for it , also this is a good time to push it locally so if i am working on it then it must have a good looking frontend page where the option will be there to create an room then the room page will be there so ther are only two pages that i need to make responsive as well man bhot acha frontend banaunga iska toh damm bro
